The simulations of TT-DMD and MAR models were performed in MATLAB and
can be found in a ".mlx" file (MATLAB notebook), while the deep learning 
models from OpenSTL and corresponding experiments can be found in at".ipynb"
file (Python notebook). Note that the Python notebook contains sample code on
a small subset of data; to run full simulations, you can utilize the full dataset.
